# Hi, I'm Katherine! ðŸ‘‹
Passionate about product, tech, and making the world better.

## ** ðŸ“š Educational Background **
I'm a Computer Science & Business double degree student at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University.

## ** ðŸŒŽ Passionate about products making an impact **
Right now, I'm working to address big issues in femtech and diversity & inclusivity. I've inspired others to do the same by founding & leading organizations such as The Product Initiative, the Laurier Startup Consulting Club, and the Girls In Tech Conference.

### ** ðŸ”œ Recruiting for internships in winter & summer 2021 **
I'm excited to embark on a new adventure in my career: building meaningful products. Most recently, I worked for Caresplit, an angel-backed platform that is revolutionizing remote working for women. I'm currently looking for Winter 2020 or Summer 2020 internships in software engineering or product management.
