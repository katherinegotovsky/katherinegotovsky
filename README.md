### Hi, I'm Katherine! ðŸ‘‹
Passionate about product, tech, and making the world better.

ðŸ“š EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND
I'm a Computer Science & Business double degree student at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University.

ðŸŒŽ PASSIONATE ABOUT PRODUCTS MAKING AN IMPACT
Right now, I'm working to address big issues in femtech and diversity & inclusivity. I've inspired others to do the same by founding & leading organizations such as The Product Initiative, the Laurier Startup Consulting Club, and the Girls In Tech Conference.

ðŸ”œ RECRUITING FOR WINTER & SUMMER 2020 INTERNSHIPS
I'm excited to embark on a new adventure in my career: building meaningful products. Most recently, I worked for Caresplit, an angel-backed platform that is revolutionizing remote working for women. I'm currently looking for Winter 2020 or Summer 2020 internships in software engineering or product management.
